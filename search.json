One of the events at the Paralympics is an open water swimming event in the Seine (apparently the water is clean or so the French say). Since the City of Amsterdam thinks it is better than Paris, they want to host an event before the Paralympics, snubbing the Parisians. The idea is to host a 5km. open water swimming event through the canals of Amsterdam. You are asked by the municipality of Amsterdam to advise on the feasibility of the event from the perspective of the safety of the partaking athletes from an environmental perspective. The event is going to be hosted in May.\n\nAMS Institute\nMSc. Metropolitan Analysis Design and Engineering\nTeam members Chua, Ka Yi Corona, Juan Jose van Winkelen Youri"

    "text": "To host an open water swim meet in the canals of Amsterdam, we must first ensure that the water quality is good enough for swimming. Unfortunately, only official bathing sites in the Amsterdam canals are monitored for water quality. Thus, there is limited data available.\nHere is the list of datasets we have identified with regards to water pollution levels, along with the relevant available sources (if existant) of information and their formats.\nWe know that there are various factors that affect the quality of water, such as sewage overflows, water currents, temperature and more. If we had data sampled at appropriate locations and sufficient background knowledge, we would use a model to estimate water pollution levels and how they are affected by weather and canal traffic. For now, we will do some simple analysis of the available data.\n# some basic analysis, e.g. min/max\nWe do know that sewage overflows are a major source of water pollution after heavy rain. [@leemans_wu_2017] Waternet recommends people to avoid swimming in the waters for 3 days after heavy rainfall. [@waternet_swimming_nodate]\nBoat traffic is another source of water pollution. Due to the lack of exhaust gas treatment systems in boat engines, as found in all modern car engines, a modern 5 horsepower 4-stroke outboard engine can be as polluting as 39 passenger cars driving at 95 km/h. [@propel_why_2022] As of 2020, there are about 12 550 boats in the canals of Amsterdam, approximately 550 of which are commercial boats, the remaining 12000 are recreational boats. Of the commercial fleet about 75% is emission free, while for recreational boats this percentage is only 5%. [@sterling_amsterdams_2020] This leaves us with ???? boats that are fossil fuel driven boats.\n# code to compute total number of fossil fuel driven boats\nFurthermore, water toxicity as a result of fossil fuelled boats can stay present up to 14 days after the use of boats [@JUTTNER19951976]."

    "text": "Finding a route\nWe consider the following factors:\n\nWater quality: Less polluted waters are safer for swimmers.\nCanal traffic: We want to minimise impact on canal traffic. Canals with less traffic would also have better quality water.\n\n\n(Swim) water quality\nWe have limited data available for water quality. However, we do know that Amsterdam uses a combined sewage system, so one of the major sources of water pollution is sewer overflows caused by heavy rainfall (Leemans, Supervisor, and Hofstra 2017). Thus, a possible precaution we can take is to avoid sewer overflow points\nThe Waternet sewerage network data is available on Overheid.nl. Unfortunately, the download link for the WFS data returned a 404 error. Instead, we used the provided API to retrieve the sewage nodes, then saved it as a GeoJSON file. (Coordinate Reference System used is EPSG:28992.) We then filtered the data to get the sewage overflow nodes.\n\nfrom urllib.request import urlopen\nimport json\nimport time\nimport os.path\n\n# geojson_filename = \"data/sewage_nodes.geojson\"\n# url = \"https://api.data.amsterdam.nl/v1/leidingeninfrastructuur/waternet_rioolknopen/?page_size=1000\"\n\n# if os.path.exists(geojson_filename):\n#     print(\"Data has already been parsed to geojson. Please view '{}'\".format(geojson_filename))\n#     exit()\n\n# api_response = json.load(urlopen(url))\n\n# data_entries = []\n# max_count = 3\n# count  = 0\n\n# while api_response is not None: # and count &lt; max_count:\n#   time.sleep(0.5)\n#   data = api_response[\"_embedded\"][\"waternet_rioolknopen\"]\n#   data_entries += data\n\n#   if \"next\" in api_response[\"_links\"]: # has next page of results\n#     api_response = json.load(urlopen(api_response[\"_links\"][\"next\"][\"href\"]))\n#   else: # is last page of results\n#     api_response = None\n\n#   count += 1\n\n\n# # print(data)\n\n# geojson = {\n#   \"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n#   \"features\": []\n# }\n\n# for entry in data_entries:\n#   # print(entry)\n#   feature = {\n#     \"type\": \"Feature\",\n#     \"geometry\": {\n#       \"type\": \"Point\",\n#       \"coordinates\": entry[\"geometrie\"][\"coordinates\"]\n#     },\n#     \"properties\": {\n#       \"id\": entry[\"id\"],\n#       \"typeKnoop\": entry[\"typeKnoop\"]\n#     }\n#   }\n\n#   geojson[\"features\"].append(feature)\n\n# with open(geojson_filename, encoding='utf-8') as outfile:\n#     json.dump(geojson, outfile)\n\n\n\nCanal traffic\nOur route should avoid areas of high canal traffic, to minimise impact on boats. This would also result in a route with cleaner water.\nWaternet commissioned TNO to produce a model to predict traffic densities in the canal. (Snelder, Minderhoud, and Calvert 2013) The prediction results from the model are as follows:\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\nRoutes used by previous open water swim events\nThe Amsterdam City Swim is held every summer in the canals of Amsterdam. We have the routes for 2019 and 2023, both of which are the same, other than the direction.\n\n\n\nAmsterdam City Swim 2019 route\n\n\n\n\n\nAmsterdam City Swim 2023 route\n\n\n\n\n\nAmsterdam City Swim 2019 & 2023 routes\n\n\n\n\nIdentifying potential routes\nBased on the City Swims, Amsterdam Oost seems to be a suitable area for open water swimming events. Visual comparison also shows that Amsterdam Oost has relatively fewer sewage overflow points and less canal traffic.\n\n\n\nAmsterdam Oost\n\n\nThus, we have identified 3 potential 5km routes in this area, indicated in the images below. Our recommendation is the third route, as it traverses the fewest number of sewage overflow points.\n\n\n\nRoute 1\n\n\n\n\n\nRoute 2\n\n\n\n\n\nRoute 3"

    "text": "Determining the optimal time with least canal traffic\nThe canals used for the open water swim will need to be closed off for the event, but we want to minimise the impact on the canal boat routes. Thus, for the continuity of boat traffic, we look towards hosting the event outside of ‘rush hours’ on the canals.\nAs can be seen in the figure below (Snelder, Minderhoud, and Calvert 2013), the busiest hours on the water usually start around 15:00. For that reason the swimming event willshould be finished before 15:00.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nNext, we need to determine the start time of the race. We know that\n\nPeople swim at speeds of about 8 km/h. (Thornton 2019)\nRequired length of the swim route is 5km.\nFor safety reasons, each wave of swimmers should have a maximum of 120 swimmers in the group. (Triathlon n.d.)\nWe plan for around 3000 swimmers for the swim meet, similar to the Amsterdam City Swim. (Swim n.d.)\n\n\n# Insert code for computations\n\n# Original text:\n# As people swim about 8 km/h, each round of 5 km would take approximately 40 minutes. \n# With maximum 120 swimmers per group it would take 25 waves to accommodate all 3000 swimmers. \n\n\nThus, the first wave of the race starts at 7:00 am with a next wave going every 20 minutes, this way the last wave will be out of the water by 15:00."
