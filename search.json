    "text": "Water: Paralympics in the Canals of Amsterdam\nParis is hosting the Paralympics in 2024. One of the events at the Paralympics is an open water swimming event in the Seine (apparently the water is clean or so the French say). Since the City of Amsterdam thinks it is better than Paris, they want to host an event before the Paralympics, snubbing the Parisians. The idea is to host a 5km. open water swimming event through the canals of Amsterdam. You are asked by the municipality of Amsterdam to advise on the feasibility of the event from the perspective of the safety of the partaking athletes from an environmental perspective. The event is going to be hosted in May.\nAMS Institute\nMSc. Metropolitan Analysis Design and Engineering\nTeam members Chua, Ka Yi Corona, Juan Jose van Winkelen Youri"

    "text": "In order to host a swimming event in the city centre of Amsterdam certain ‘variables’ or risks need to be assessed. Our field of attention is subdivided in the following categories: safety, continuity of boat traffic, sustainability and economic feasibility. \n\nFirst of these categories is safety, the safety of all swimmers must be ensured during the whole duration of the race. During the event safety measures consist of: - Lifeguards in canoes;  As advised by the Open Water Swimming Safety Guide for Multi-Sport Events from the British Triathlon organisation boats should be in the water to be able to rescue swimmers in distress. A ratio of a minimum of one boat per twenty swimmers is advised in waters where shorelines are easily reachable. A swimmer should also always be within 50 meters range of a lifeguard. (British Triathlon, 2023) Since most of the chosen route goes through canals it is deemed unsafe to have boats sailing so close alongside the swimmers. For that reason lifeguards will be present every 50 meters in canoes instead of on boats. This also contributes to the sustainability of the event. - Safety platforms in the water;  To make sure distressed swimmers can easily leave the water platforms are placed every 100m alongside the swimming route where quay walls make exiting the water difficult."

    "text": "For the second category, continuity of boat traffic, we look towards hosting the event outside of ‘rush hours’ on the canals.\nAs can be seen in the figure below the busiest hours on the water usually start around 15:00.\nFor that reason the swimming event will be finished before 15:00.\nAs people swim about 8 km/h, each round of 5 km would take approximately 40 minutes. (Thornton 2019)\nWith maximum 120 swimmers per group it would take 25 waves to accommodate all 3000 swimmers. (Triathlon n.d.)\nThe first wave of the race starts at 7:00 am with a next wave going every 20 minutes, this way the last wave will be out of the water by 15:00.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nThornton, Jodi \"Jato\". 2019. “The Speed of Human Swimming.” LIVESTRONG.COM. https://www.livestrong.com/article/456880-the-speed-of-human-swimming/.\n\n\nTriathlon, British. n.d. “Open Water Swimming Safety Guide for Multi-Sport Events.” British Triathlon.
