# Water Quality

## First assignment

### This first assignment is focused on the pollution levels of the water in the canals and the different formats of data available. 

As a preliminary statement it is important to say that since the Amsterdam canals are not official bathing sites, water quality in them is not tested.

Find below the different **parameters** that we came up with in regards to water pollution levels along with the **relevant available sources** (if existant) of information and their **formats**.

**Safety for swimmers**

| # | Parameter | Explanation | Source | Format
