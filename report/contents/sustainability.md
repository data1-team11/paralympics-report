Due to the lack of exhaust gas treatment systems in boat engines, as found in all modern car engines, a modern 5 horsepower 4-stroke outboard engine can be as polluting as 39 passenger cars driving at 95 km/h. (Propel, 2022) There are about 12550 boats in the canals of Amsterdam, approximately 550 of those are commercial boats, the remaining 12000 are recreational boats. Of the commercial fleet about 75% is emission free, while for recreational boats this percentage is only 5%. (Sterling, 2020) Water toxicity as a result of fossil fuelled boats can stay present up to 14 days after the use of boats (Jüttner, et al., 1994). For these reasons no fossil fuelled boats are used during the city swim.<br><br>
