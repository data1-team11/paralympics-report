    "\n",
    "Using a program to find routes allowed us to search more comprehensively in less time.\n",
    "However, the program is constrained by the assumptions built into the code, as well as the provided datasets.\n",

    "\n",
    "Given more time and resources, we would use these identified gaps as a guide to look for more data.\n",
    "Through repeated iterations, we can hopefully find a solution that humans may miss out (since we are less thorough), but that considers the broad set of factors that we use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, data can be hard to collect and datasets hard to find, and not all intuitions can be easily made explicit.\n",
