    "Due to the lack of exhaust gas treatment systems in boat engines, as found in all modern car engines, a modern 5 horsepower 4-stroke outboard engine can be as polluting as 39 passenger cars driving at 95 km/h. [@propel_why_2022] There are about 12550 boats in the canals of Amsterdam, approximately 550 of those are commercial boats, the remaining 12000 are recreational boats. Of the commercial fleet about 75% is emission free, while for recreational boats this percentage is only 5%. [@sterling_amsterdams_2020] Water toxicity as a result of fossil fuelled boats can stay present up to 14 days after the use of boats [@JUTTNER19951976]. For these reasons no fossil fuelled boats are used during the city swim."
